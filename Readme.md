# Wemasu - filetransfer

This project was made by [Pieter Deconinck](https://github.com/Pieter-Deconinck) & [Stephan van hemelrijck](https://github.com/StephanVanHemelrijck) during the summer of 2022. 

The idea of this project was learn and also utilize the skills we learned during the schoolyear, we decided on making our own version of a filetransfer website like Wetransfer.

This project uses javascript/nodeJS for the backend, and normal html/css/javascript for the frontend. Our focus was mainly on learining to use nodeJS and backend structure, and dealing with the challenges of hosting such a website. 

This project has been concluded but might be revisited later, it's currently hosted on https://wemasu.com
